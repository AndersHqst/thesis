Plots in this folder demonstrates what happens if we look at the Faust results at from depth 3.
The node for each clade has been moved up to depth 3, when possible. It shows that the correlations are completely different 
at this level, and that we would not be able to discover the same correlations as Faust did.

Some Faust results are also from clades in the same Lineage, and we therefor have to do the same. That is, build the model with all
nodes included.
