Experiment with all nodes in phylogenetic tree.

Setup:
    Sample abundance counts are made relative to the sample.
    Data is discretized with the maxent discretization.


Questions:
    We can only mine pairs, as sample space is 2**354.
        How 'heavy' is it to mine e.g. triplets?

    Can we even do this? I.e. can we make the BIC score converge.
    What is the summary?        
        Only stuff in same lineage?
        Do we get any of the Faust results?
        Can we query the Faust results?
        Does this make sense biologically? 
            - Talk to bio about this.
        Do the patterns overlap?
            Build grap to easily visualize this.


Report:
    Write about results based on above questions.
    Create scatter plots for summary, with discretization lines.
        Put representative plot
