Experiment with reproducing Faust results.

How big a subtree of the strong Faust results can we build?
Without same-lineage of clades.
Unresolved subtrees are included at the leafs.

Setup:
    Sample abundance counts are made relative to the sample.
    Data is discretized with the maxent discretization.

Questions:
    What are the assocaition rules for the faust correlation results?
    Calculate pearson phi according to mode
        Line these up in a table and compare.
        Include:
            Faust pearson+spearman,
            (key) Faust relationship
            Faust relationship strength
            model pearson phi
            model assocaition rule X->Y
            model assocaition rule Y->X
            In summary?

    Write about results based on above questions.
