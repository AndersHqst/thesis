Experiment with only bacteria at the lowest levels. These are at level 5. Do not include leafs at lower depths.


Setup:
    Sample abundance counts are made relative to the sample.
    Data is discretized with the maxent discretization.

Questions:

    What is the summary?
        Assert nothing is in same lineage.
        Do we get any of the Faust results?
            Find leaf to leaf in Faust results.
            Is there a connected component in the Faust results graph
            corresponding to the hyper-node we have found.
        Can we query the Faust (leaf) results?
        Does this make sense biologically?
            - Talk to bio about this, show them patterns.
        Build hyper-graph to visualize this.
            Do the patterns overlap?

Report:
    Write about results based on above questions.
