## Getting started
To use PyMTV from the command line:

    ./main.py -h

To import PyMTV as a Python module

    from mtv import MTV
    dataset = [1,2,3]
    mtv = MTV(dataset)


## Settings

The settings.py file contains the default settings for MTV. 
Use ./main.py -h from the command line to get a description 
of the different settings.

PyMTV was written as a part of this (TODO: link) thesis written at the IT univerity of Copenhagen.
