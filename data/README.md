# Datasets

This folder contains various datasets related to the HMP.

* hmp.lq.phylotype.filter.tab dataset with bacteria abundances of samples taken at various bodysites.
* faust_results_dots.csv results from Fauest. et al study
* Stool.tab is an extract of hmp.lq.phylotype.filter.tab for only stool samples
# example.dat and example_seed.dat are examples of input files to the MTV implementation

To create new datasets, as subset of hmp.lq.phylotype.filter.tab, with discretization, relative abundance counts and other, some scripts in
/bin/preprocessing may be helpful
